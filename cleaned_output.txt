Purpos e Sectio n 2. Credit Allowed a Domestic Ceding Insurer Section 3. Asset or Reduction from Liability for Reinsurance Ce ded by a Domestic Insurer to an Assuming Insurer not Meeting the Requ irements of Section 2 Section 4. Qualified U.S. Financial Institutions Section 5. Rules and Regulations Section 6. Reinsurance Agreements Affected Section 1. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to protect the interest of insureds, claimants, ceding insure rs, assuming insurers and the public generally. The legislature hereby declares its intent is to ensure adequate regulation of insurers and reinsurers and adequate protection for those to whom they owe obligations. In furtherance of that state intere st, th e legislature hereby provides a mandate that upon the insolvenc y of a non -U.S. insurer or reinsurer that provides security to fund its U.S. obligations in accordance with this Act, the assets representing the security shall be maintained in the Unite d Stat es and claims shall be filed with and valued by

the state insur ance co mmission er with regulatory oversight, and the assets shall be distributed, in accordance with the insurance laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic U.S. insurance companies. The legislatur e decla res that the matters contained in this Act are fundamental to the business of insurance in accordance with 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011 -1012. Section 2. Credit Allowed a Domestic Ceding Ins urer Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduct ion from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of Subsections A, B, C, D, E , F or G of this section; provided further, that the commissioner may adopt by regulation pursuant to Section 5B specific addit ional requirements relating to or setting forth: (1) the valuation of assets or reserve credits; (2) the amount and forms of security supporting reinsuran ce arrangements described in Section 5B; and/or (3) the circumstances pursua nt to which credit will be reduced or eliminated. Drafting Note: This new regulatory authority is being added in response to reinsurance arrangements entered into, directly

or ind irectly, w ith life/health insurer -affiliated captives, special purpose vehicles or s imilar entities that may not have the same statutory acco unting requirements or solvency requirements as US -based multi -state life/health insurers. To assist in achieving n ational un iformity, commissioners are asked to strongly consider adopting regulation s that are substantially similar in all material respects to NAIC adopted model regulations in the handling and treatment of such reinsurance arrangements. Credit shall be allowed u nder Subsections A, B or C of this section only as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business which the assuming insur er is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and l icensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Credit shall be all owed under Subsections C or D of this section only if the applicable requirements of Subsection H have been satisf ied. A. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insure r that is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state. Drafting

Note: A state that provides for licensing of reinsurance by line, for consistency should ad opt an amen ded version of Subsection A requiring the assuming insurer to be “license d to transact reinsurance in this state.” B. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited by the commissioner as a reins urer in this state. In order to be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer m ust: (1) File with the commissioner evidence of its submission to this state’s jurisdiction; (2) Submit to this state’s authority to examine its books and records; Credit for Reinsurance Model Law MO-785-2 © 201 9 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (3) Be licen sed to tran sact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or in the cas e of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state; (4) File annually with the commission er a copy o f its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state o f domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and (5) Demonstrate to the satisfaction of

the commissioner that it has adequate financial capacity t o meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reins urance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an am ount not le ss than $20,000,000 and its accreditation has not been denied by t he comm issioner within ninety (90) days after submission of its application. Drafting Note: To qualify as an accredited reinsurer, an assuming insurer must meet all of the requir ements and the standards set forth in Subsection B. If the commissioner of i nsurance determines that the assuming insurer has failed to continue to meet any of these qualifications, the commissioner may, upon written notice and hearing, revoke accreditatio n. C. (1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assum ing insurer that is domiciled in, or in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer is entered through, a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance s ubstantially similar to those applicable under this statute and the assuming insurer or U.S. branch of an

alien assuming insurer: (a) Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20,000,000; and (b) Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records. (2) The requirement of Sectio n 2C(1)(a) does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system. Drafting Note: The term “substantia lly similar” means standards that equal or exceed the standards of the enact ing state, as determined by the commissioner of the enacting state. It is expected that the NAIC will maintain a list of states whose laws establish standards that equal or exceed the standard s of this model act. D. (1) Credit shall be allowed when the re insuranc e is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund in a qualified U.S. financial institution, as defined in Section 4B, for the payment of the valid claims of its U.S. cedin g insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. To enable t he comm issioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the commissioner information substantially the same as that required to be report

ed on the NAIC Annual Statement form by licensed insurers. The a ssuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the commissioner and bear the expense of examination. (2) (a) Credit for reinsurance shall not be granted u nder this subsection unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the t rust ha ve been approved by: (i) The commissioner of the state w here the trust is domiciled; or (ii) The commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrum ent, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust. (b) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust ins trument shal l provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable up on the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insu rer’s U.S. ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The tr ust and the assuming insurer shall be subject

to examination as determined by the commissioner. NAIC Model La ws, Regulations, Gu idelines and O ther Resourc es—Summer 2019 © 201 9 National Association of I nsurance Co mmissioners MO-785-3 (c) The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outsta nding oblig ations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. No late r than February 28 of each year the trustee of the trust shall report to the commissioner in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust’s investments at the pre ceding year - end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if s o planne d, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31. (3) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurer: (a) The trust fund for a single assuming insurer shall consist of funds in trus t in an amount not less than the assuming insurer’s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a t rusteed sur plus of not less than $20,000,000, except as provided in P aragrap h 3(b) o f

this subsection . (b) At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the commissio ner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authoriz e a redu ction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of U.S. ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably for eseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer’s liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent (30%) of the assuming insur er’s li abilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by U.S. ceding insurers covered by the trust. (c) (i) In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporat ed underwri ters: (I) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements wit

h an inc eption, amendment or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters’ several liabilitie s attributable to business ceded by U.S. domiciled ceding insurer s to any underwriter of the group; (II) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before December 31, 1992, and not amended or renewed after that date, not -withstanding the other provisions of this Act, the trust shal l consis t of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters’ several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business wr itten in the United States; an d (III) In addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of the U.S. domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account; and (ii) The incorporated members of the group shall not be engaged in any bus iness other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the

group’s domiciliary regulator as are the uni ncorporated members. (iii) Within ninety (90) days after its financial state ments a re due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the group’s domiciliary regulator of the s olvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, fin ancial statements, Credit for Reinsurance Model Law MO-785-4 © 201 9 National Association of Insurance Commissioners prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group. (d) In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall: (i) Have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three (3) years immediately prior to making application for accreditation; (ii) Maintain aggregate policyholders’ surplus of at lea st $10,000, 000,000; (iii) Maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the grou p’s several liabilities attributable to business ceded by U.S. domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group; (iv) In addition, maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of

U.S. domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities; and (v) Within ninety (9 0) days aft er its financial statements are due to be filed with the group’s domiciliary regulator, make available to the commissioner an annual certification of each underwriter member’s solvency by the member’s domiciliary regulator and financial statemen ts of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent publi c accoun tant. Drafting Note: Unless otherwise stated, “commissioner” refers to the commissioner of insurance in the state where credit or a reduction from liability is taken. Drafting Note: Consideration was given to deferring to state capital and surplu s requir ements as a threshold for the trusteed surplus, but it was concluded that, on the basis of risk exposure and current industry security practices, the standards for credit s hould be hi gher under Subsection D. The $100,000,000 trusteed surplus requir ement fo r a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters reflects the higher financial standards currently found among the states for a group of this typ e. The $20, 000,000 trusteed surplus requirement is an option available to as suming i nsurers that do not

satisfy both the licensing and financial standards of Subsection B or C. E. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insure r that has been certified by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secur es its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. (1) In order to be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the following requirements: (a) The assuming insurer must be domiciled and licensed to transact ins urance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to P aragraph (3) of this subsection; (b) The assuming insurer must maintain minimum cap ital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determine d by the commissioner pursuant to regulation; (c) The assuming insurer must maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the commissio ner pursuant to regulation; (d) The assuming insurer must agree to submit t o the ju risdiction of this state, appoint the commissioner as its agent for service of process in this state, and agree to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer’ s liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by

U.S. ceding insurers if i t resist s enforcement of a final U.S. judgment; (e) The assuming insurer must agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis ; and NAIC Model La ws, Regulations, Gu idelines and O ther Resourc es—Summer 2019 © 201 9 National Association of I nsurance Co mmissioners MO-785-5 (f) The assuming insurer must satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the commissioner. (2) An association including incorporated and individua l unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer. In order to be e ligible for certification, in addition to satisfying requirements of Paragraph (1): (a) The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and sur plus equivalents (net of liabilities) of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the commiss ioner to pr ovide adequate protection; (b) The incorporated members of the a ssociati on shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting

as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association’s domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members; a nd (c) Within ninety (90) days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association’s domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the commissioner a n annual certification by the association’s domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member; or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the associat ion. (3) The commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdiction s, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in such jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer. (a) In ord er to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non -U.S. assumi ng insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the r ights, benefits and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non -U.S. jurisdiction to

reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the U.S. A qualified jurisdiction mus t agree to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respec t to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the juris diction doe s not adequately and promptly enforce final U.S. judgments and ar bitratio n awards. Additional factors may be considered in the discretion of the commissioner. (b) A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the NAIC Committee P rocess. The commissioner shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions. If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the commissioner shall provide thoroughly docume nted justif ication in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulat ions. (c) U.S. jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions. (d) If a certified reinsurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a q ualified jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer’s certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation. (4) The commissioner shall assign a rating to each

ce rtified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial stre ngth rat ings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner pursuant to regulation. The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsur ers and the ir ratings . Credit for Reinsurance Model Law MO-785-6 © 201 9 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (5) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations a ssumed f rom U.S. ceding insurers under this subsection at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in regulations promulgated by the commissioner. (a) In order for a domes tic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsu rance ce ded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of Section 3, or in a multibe neficiary trust in accordance with Subsection D of this section, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. (b) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to Subsection D of this section, and choose s to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall

maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subsection or comparab le laws of other U.S. jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to Subsection D of this section. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under Subsection E of this section t hat the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of t he trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, upon termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account. (c) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in Subsection D are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such tr ust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10,000,000. (d) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subsection, i f the security is insufficient , the commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proport ionate to the deficiency, and has

the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer’s obligations will not be paid in full when due. (e) For purposes of this subsection, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations. (i) As used in this subsection, the term “terminated” refers to revocation, suspensi on, voluntary surrender and inactive status. (ii) If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsur er whose certification has been suspended. (6) If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in an NAIC accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner has the dis cretion to defer to that jurisdiction’s certification, and has the discretio n to def er to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and such assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state. (7) A certified reinsurer that ceases to ass ume new business in this state may request to maintain its certif

ication in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in- force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and the commissioner shall assign a rati ng that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. F. (1) Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an ass uming insur er meeting each of the conditions set forth below. NAIC Model La ws, Regulations, Gu idelines and O ther Resourc es—Summer 2019 © 201 9 National Association of I nsurance Co mmissioners MO-785-7 (a) The ass uming insurer must have its head offi ce or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a Reciprocal Jurisdiction.

The commissioner may require that co nsent for servic e of process be provided to the commissioner and included in each reinsur ance agreement. Nothing in th is provi sion shall limit, or in any way alter , the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resoluti on mechanisms, e xcept to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under appli cable inso lvency or delinquency laws; Credit for Reinsurance Model Law MO-785-8 © 201 9 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (iii) The assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insure r or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdicti on where t he judgment was obtained; (iv) Each reinsurance agreement must include a provision requiring t he assuming

(h) Nothing in this provision precludes an assuming insurer from providing the commissioner with information on a voluntary basis . (2) The commis sioner shall timely cre ate and publish a list of Reciprocal Juris dictions. (a) A list of Reciprocal Jur isdictio ns is published through the NAIC Committee Process. The commissioner’s list shall include any Reciprocal Jurisdiction as defin ed under

Section 2F(1)(a)(i) and (ii), a nd shall consider any other Reciprocal Jur isdiction included on the NAIC list. The commiss ioner may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the NAIC list of Reciprocal Jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under regulations issue d by the commissioner . (b) The commissioner may remo ve a jurisdiction from the list of Re ciprocal Jurisdictions upon a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a Reciprocal Jurisdictio n, in accordance with a process set forth in regulations issued by the commissione r, except th at the commissioner shall not remove from the list a Reciprocal Jurisdiction as defined under Section 2F(1)(a)(i) and (ii). Upon removal of a Reciprocal Jurisdict ion from this lis t credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer which has its home offi ce or is domiciled in that ju risdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed pursuant to [cite to state law equivalent to Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) ]. NAIC Model La ws, Regulations, Gu idelines and O ther Resourc es—Summer 2019 © 201 9 National Association of I nsurance Co mmissioners MO-785-9 (3) The commissione r shall timely

create an d publish a list of assuming insurers tha t have satis fied the conditions set forth in this subsection and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this subsection. The commissioner may add an assuming insurer to such list if an NAIC accredited jurisdiction has added such assum ing insurer to a list of such assuming insurers o r if, upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the commissioner as required under Par agraph (1)(d) of this su bsection and complies wi th any additional requirements that the c ommissioner may impose by regulation, exc ept to t he extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement. (4) If the commissioner determines that an assumi ng insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this subsection, the com missioner ma y revoke or suspend the eligi bility o f the assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures set forth in regulation. (a) While an assuming insurer’s eligibility is s uspended, no reinsurance agreement issued, amended or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the assuming

insurer’s obligations under the contract ar e secured in accordance with Section 3. (b) If an assuming insurer’s eligibility is revo ked, no cred it for reinsurance may be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insure r, including reinsurance agreements entered i nto prior to the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer’s obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with the provisions of Sec tion 3.

unless the assuming insurer agrees in the rei nsurance agreements: (1) (a) That in the event of the failure of the assumi ng insurer to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to t he jurisdiction of any court of com petent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with al l requir ements n ecessary to give the court jurisdiction, and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the even t of an appeal; and (b) To designate the commissioner or a designated attorney as its true and la wful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer. (2) This subsect ion is not intended to conflict with o r override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance ag reement to arb itrate their dis putes, if this obligation is created in the agreement. I. If the assuming ins urer does not meet the requirements of Subsections A, B, C or F, the credit permitted by

Subsection D or E of this section shall not be allowed unless the assuming i nsurer a grees in the trust agreements to the following conditions: (1) Notwithstanding any ot her provisions in the trust instrument, if the tru st fund is inad equate because it co ntains an amount less than the amount required by Subsec tion D(3) of t his sec tion, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or cou ntry of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the commis sioner with reg ulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the commi ssioner with regul atory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund. (2) The assets shall b e distributed by and claims s hall be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight in accorda nce with the laws of the state in which the tru st is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

(4) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it u nder U.S. law that i s inconsistent with this provision. J. If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases t o meet t he requirements for accreditation or certification, the commissioner may suspe nd or revoke the reinsurer’s accreditation or c ertification. (1) The commissioner must give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hea ring. The susp ension or revocatio n may not take effect until after the commissioner’s order on hearing, unless: (a) The reinsurer waives its right to hearing; (b) The commissione r’s order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrende r or termination of the reinsurer’s eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance b usiness in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in t he primary certifying state

of the reinsurer under Subparagraph E(6) of this section; or NAIC Model La ws, Regulations, Gu idelines and O ther Resourc es—Summer 2019 © 201 9 National Association of I nsurance Co mmissioners MO-785-11 (c) The commis sioner find s that a n emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not st ayed the commissioner’s action. (2) While a reinsurer’s accr editation or certific ation is suspended, no reinsurance contract issued or renewed after t he effectiv e date o f the su spension qualifies for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer’s oblig ations under the contract are secured in acco rdance with S ection 3. If a reinsurer’s accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsuranc e may be gr anted af ter the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer’s obligations under the contract are secured in acco rdance with Su bsection E(5) or Sect ion 3.

The notification shall de monstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer. Section 3. Asset or Reduct ion f rom Lia bility f or Reins urance Ceded by a Domestic Insurer to an

Assuming Insurer not Meeting the Requ irements of Section 2 An asset or a reductio n from liability for the reinsurance c eded by a domestic insurer to an assuming insurer not meeting the requir ements of Secti on 2 sha ll be allowed in an amount not exceeding the liabilities carried by the ceding insurer ; provided further, that the commissione r may adopt by regulation pursuant to Section 5B specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth: (1 ) the va luation of assets or reserve credits; (2) the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in Section 5B; and/or (3) the circumstances purs uant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated. Drafting Note : This new re gulatory authori ty is being added in response to reinsurance arrangements entered into, direct ly or indirectly, with life/health insurer -affiliated captiv es, special purpose veh icles or similar entities that may not have the same statutory acco untin g requi rements or solve ncy requirements as US -based multi -state life/health insurers. To assist in ac hieving national uniformity, commissioners ar e asked to stro ngly consider adopting regulations that are substantially similar in all material

respects to N AIC ado pted mod el regul ations in the handling and treatment of such reinsurance arrangements. The re duction shall be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds held in trust for the ceding insurer , under a rein suran ce cont ract with the as suming insurer as security for the payment of obligations thereunder, if the s ecurity is held in the United States subject to withdrawal s olely by, and under the exclusive control of, the ceding insurer; or, in the case of a tru st, held in a qualif ied U.S. financial institution, as defined in Section 4B. This security may be in the form of: A. Cash; B. Securities listed by the Securities V aluation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, incl uding those de emed exempt from fil ing as defined by the Purposes and Procedures Manual of the Securities Valuation Office, and qualifying as admitted assets; C. (1) Clean, irrevoc able, unconditional letters of credit, issued or confirmed by a qualified U. S. financial institution, as defin ed in Se ction 4A, effective no later than December 31 of

the year for which the filing is being made, and in the possession of, or in trust for, t he ceding insurer on or before the filing date of its annual statement; Credit for Reinsurance Model Law MO-785-12 © 201 9 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (2) Letters of cr edit meeting applica ble stan dards of issuer acceptability as of the dates of their issuance (or confirmat ion) shall, notwithstanding the issuing (or confir ming) insti tution’s subsequent fail ure to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptabi lity, continue to be accep table as securit y until their expiration, extension, renewal, modification or amendment, whic hever first occurs; or Drafting Note: Providin g for the cont inuing acceptability of letters of credit whose issuers were acceptable when the credit su pport facili ty was f irst obtained is intended to avoid abrupt interruptions in the acceptability of credi t support arrangements that run for specific pe riods of time, and thus unnecessary di sruptions in the marketplace, on account of the issu ing (or confir ming) institution’s subseque nt failure to meet applicable standards of issuer acceptability (whether by v irtue of a change in the issuing institution’s abi

lity to qua lify under the original standards or as a result of revisions to the applica ble standards) . The provis ion stip ulates t hat letters of credit acceptable when first obtained will, in the event of th e subsequent nonqualification of the issuing (o r confirming) institution, continue to be acceptable as security until the account party a nd beneficiary woul d first have, i n the no rmal course of business, an opportunity to replace the credit support facilit y. D. Any other form of security acceptable to the commissio ner. Drafting Note: There is no implication in the requirement that the se curity for the paym ent of obligations must be held under the exclusive control of the ceding insurer that either the reserve liability or the assets held in relation to the reserve liability have not been transferred for the purposes of statutory accountin g by the cedin g ins urer to the rei nsurer. Section 4. Qualified U.S. Financial Institutions A. For purposes of Section 3C, a “qualified U.S. financial institution” m eans an institution that: (1) Is orga nized or (in the case of a U.S. office of a foreign banking organi

zatio n) lice nsed, under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (2) Is regulated, supervised and examined by U.S. federal or state authorit ies having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies; and (3) Has been determin ed by either t he co mmissio ner or t he Secur ities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to meet such standards of financial condition and standing a s are considered necessary and appropriate to regulate the quality of financ ial institutio ns wh ose let ters of credit w ill be acceptable to the commissioner. Drafting Note: The NAIC’s Securities Valuation Office (SVO) maintains, on a current basis, a list of all U.S. financial in stitutions that have, upon application to the SVO, b een determined to m eet the eligibi lity sta ndards of its Purposes and Procedures Manual . These standards , developed by t he NAIC’s L etter of Credit (EX4) Study Group, make use of nat ionally recognized ratin gs services, and are more rigorous in the case of fo reign banking organization s (whose standby letters of credit must be issued or confirmed by a qualified U.S. financial institution)

than those that are applicable to dom estic finan cial institutions whose standby letters of credit would be considered accept able. B. A “q ualified U.S . financ ial institution” means, for purposes of those provisions of this law specifying those institutions that are eligible to act as a fid uciary of a tr ust, an institution that: (1) Is organized, or, in the case of a U.S. branc h or agency of fice of a fo reign ba nking or ganization, licensed, under the laws of the United States or any state thereo f and has been granted authority to operate wit h fiduciary powers; and (2) Is regula ted, supervised and examined by federal or state aut horities havin g reg ulatory authori ty over banks and trust companies. Drafting Note: Because assets held in a fiduciary capacity are not subject to the claims of the tru stee’s cred itors, and because the t rust departments of all U.S. financial institutions (including U.S . bra nch or agency o ffices o f foreign banking organizations having fiduciary powers in the U.S.) are regu lated, supervised and examined by the instituti on’s primary U .S. bank regulatory auth ority

(federal or state), there is no need to apply additional sta ndard s measu ring the financi al condition or standing of the institution, as in the case of determining th ose institutions whose standby letter of credit obligations w ill be considered accept able. Section 5. Rules and Regulations A. The comm issioner may a dopt rules a nd regul ations implementing the provisions of this law. Drafting Note: It is recognized that credit for reinsurance also can be affected b y other sectio ns of the enacting state ’s code, e.g., a statutory insolvency clause or an i ntermediary cl ause. It is recommen ded that states that do not have a statutory insolvency clause or an intermediary clause consider incorporating such clauses in thei r legislation. NAIC Model La ws, Regulations, Gu idelines and O ther Resourc es—Summer 2019 © 201 9 National Association of I nsurance Co mmissioners MO-785-13 B. The commissioner is further authorized to adopt rules and regul ations a pplicable to r einsu rance arrangeme nts desc ribed in Paragraph (1) of this Section 5B. Drafting Note: This new regulatory authority is being added in response to reins urance arrang ements entered into,

dire ctly or indirectly, with life/health insurer -affili ated captives, special pur pose veh icles or similar entities that may not have the same statutory acco unting requirements or solvency requirements as US -based multi -state life/healt h insurers. To assist in achieving national uniformity, commissioners are as ked to strongl y con sider a dopting regulati ons that are substantially similar in all material respects to NAIC adopted model regulations in the handling and treatment o f such polici es and reinsurance arrang ements. (1) A regulation adopted pursuant to this Section 5B, ma y apply only to rein surance relating to: (a) Life insurance policies with guaranteed n onlevel gross premiums or guaranteed nonlevel benefits; (b) Unive rsal life ins urance policies with provisions resulting in the ability of a policyholder to keep a polic y in force o ver a secondary guarantee period; (c) Variable annuities with guaranteed death or living benefits; (d) Long- term care insurance policies; o r (e) Such other life and health insu rance and annuity products as to which the NAIC adopts model regu latory requi rements with res pect to credit for reinsurance. (2) A regulation adopted pursuant to Paragraph 1(a)

or 1(b) of this Section 5B, may apply to any treaty c ontaining (i) policies is sued on or after January 1, 2015, and/or (ii) polic ies issued pri or to Januar y 1, 201 5, if ri sk pertaining to such pre -2015 policies is cede d in connection with the treaty, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 2015 . Draftin g Note: The NAIC’s Actuar ial Guideline XLVIII (AG 48) became effective January 1, 2015, and cov ers pol icies ce ded on o r after this date unless they were ceded as par t of a reserve financing arrangement as of December 31, 2014. One regulation c ontemplated b y this revision to the NA IC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) is intended to substantially replicate th e requir ements f or the amounts and forms of security held under the rules provided in AG 48. AG 48 was written to sunset upon a state’ s adoption (pursuant to the enabling authorit y of the preceding paragraph) of a regulation with terms substant ially simila r to AG 48. The preceding paragraph is intended to provide cont inuity of rules applicable to

those policies and reinsurance arrangemen ts, including continuity as to the policies c overed by such rules. The preceding paragraph is no t intended to chang e the s cope of, or coll ateral requirements for policies and treaties c overed under AG 48. (3) A regulation adopted pursuant to this Section 5B may require the ceding insurer, in calcula ting the amounts or forms of security required to be held under r egula tions p romulgat ed under this authority, to use the Valuation Manual adopted by the NAIC under Section 11B(1) of the NAIC Standard Valuation L aw, including all am endments adopted by the N AIC and in effect on the date as of which the calcu lation is made , to the ext ent appl icable. (4) A regulation adopted pursuant to this Sect ion 5B shall not apply to cessions to an assuming insurer that: (a) Meets the conditions set f orth in Section 2F of the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) in this state or, if this state has not adopted provisions substantially equivalent to Section 2F of the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) , the assuming insurer is operating in accordance

with provi sions substantially equivalent to Section 2F of the Credit for Reinsurance M odel Law (#785) in a minim um of f ive (5) other st ates; or (b) Is certified in this state or, if this state has not adopted provisions substantially e quivalent to Section 2E of the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) , certified in a minimum of five (5) other states; or (c) Maintain s at least $ 250 million in c apital and surplus when determined in acco rdance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Proced ures Manual , including all amendments theret o adopted by the NAIC, exc luding the impact of any permitted or prescribed practices; and is Credit for Reinsurance Model Law MO-785-14 © 201 9 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (i) licensed in at least 26 states; or (ii) licensed in at least 10 states , and licensed or accredited in a total of at least 35 states. (5) The authority to adopt regul ations pursuant to this Se ction 5B does not limit the commissioner’s general authority to adopt regula tions pursuant t o Section 5A of this law. Section 6. Reinsurance Agreements Affected This Act shall apply

to all cessions after the effective date of th is Act under reinsurance agreements that have an inception, anniversary or r enewal date no t less than six (6) months a fter the effective date of this Act. Drafting Note: The enacting state may wish to provide a delay in the applicability greater than six (6) months to allow time f or the insurance commissioner to promulgate regula tions and to a llow reinsur ers to p repare and submit qualifying data. _____________________________ Chronological Summary of Actions (All references are to the Proceedings of th e NAIC ). 1984 Proc.

I 13. In the course of several insolvencies, the regulators of one state learned a great deal about reinsurance activities which may be highly questionable or fraudulent. They prepared a report with proposals for dealing with insurance and reinsurance fraud. 1983 Proc. I 836- 837. The proposals included development of a model law on reinsurance. 1983 Proc. I 837, 1983 Proc. II 845. A draft of the model was published in 1983. It bore little resemblance to the version adopted six months later. Attendees at the December 1983 meeting were urged to provide comments on the model. 1984 Proc. I 743- 745. A group of regulators met in early 1994 and agreed that a number of questi ons pertaining to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law had not yet been

addressed or fully resolved. 1994 Proc. 1st Quarter 636. A suggestion was made to include provisions from an earlier NAIC proposal for a federal non -U.S. insurer act in to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law. The federal proposal provided that no credit for reinsurance would be allowed unless the reinsurer was reviewed by the NAIC, even though the ceding company held collateral. The working group agreed to recommend that provision s of the federal bill not be included in the model act. 1994 Proc. 4th Quarter 941. After the model revisions had been adopted by the Executive Committee, a commissioner suggested that the drafting could be improved. The model was held at the Plenary un til questions related to form could be resolved. 1996 Proc. 2nd Quarter 9. Technical amendments were completed before the Fall National Meeting and the model was adopted by the Plenary. 1996 Proc. 2nd Quarter 12. Section 1. Purpose This section was ad ded to the model during the 1995 and 1996 drafting of amendments. This section was proposed to give explicit expression to the legislative intent of the law with respect to security established to secure the obligations of alien insurers. The author said

the proposed language would permit the U.S. regulator to defer to an alien liquidator in the disposition of trust assets of an insolvent alien reinsurer if that was the regulator’s preference. She said the regulator’s position would be stronger if the statute included the language, but there could be no assurance that the proposed language would be sufficient to preserve the U.S. regulator’s access to trust assets. Assurance would only come with amendment to Section 304 of the federal Bankruptcy Code to give the U.S. regulator priority in exercising supervisory authority over the trust over the alien liquidator seeking to marshal all assets of the insolvent insurer. 1996 Proc. 1st Quarter 823. The new Section 1 was based on New York law and was intended to clarify that the trust funds required by the law serve as security for insureds, claimants, ceding insurers, assuming insurers and the public. Additionally, the amendment specifies that the U.S. regulator will control distribution of the funds. 1996 Proc. 1st Quarter 821. After the model had been adopted by the drafters and forwarded to the Executive Committee for consideration, an interested party suggested that the new Section 1 might not be entirely appropriate for the

purpose intended. She sai d the original objective had been to introduce new language to clarify the legislative intent underlying the credit for reinsurance statute as respects the collateral required to secure the obligations of alien reinsurers operating in the United States on the basis of multiple beneficiary trust funds, as provided in Section 2D of the model law. She indicated that at a recent hearing objecti ons had been raised to the use of “inflammatory references.” The working group decided to eliminate the third sentence which read: “It is intended that U.S. claimants should not be required to resort to the often insuperable obstacle of resorting to distant forums for the purpose of asserting legal rights or claims on contracts issued to U.S. residents and subject to U. S. laws.” 1996 Proc. 2nd Quarter 864. NAIC Model Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Other Resources —January 2012 CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE MODEL LAW Proceeding Citations Cited to the Proceedings of the NAIC PC-785-2 © 2012 National Association of Insurance Commissioners Section 2. Credit Allowed a Domestic Ceding Insurer A principal regulatory tool applicable to reinsurance, particularly reinsurance ceded to unauthorized insurers, is the recognition on a ceding company’s financial statement of credit

for unearned premium and loss reserves ceded to an assuming insurer. Through a questionnaire sent to all states, the advisory committee concluded that there was little uniformity among the states. Statutory standards for credit for r einsurance were generally inadequate and a uniform law was needed to upgrade those standards. 1984 Proc. II 843. In the original model, credit was allowed in three situations: (1) where the assuming insurer is licensed in the state, or ( 2) satisfies cer tain financial standards, or (3) maintains an adequate trusteed surplus in the United States. In the event one of these criteria is not satisfied, the ceding insurer may be allowed to reduce its liability to the extent of certain security. Cessions of ri sks located in another jurisdiction and mandated by the law of that jurisdiction are excepted from the requirements. 1984 Proc. II 843. In September of 1989 a completely revised model with a much expanded Section 2 was adopted. 1990 Proc. IB 857- 861. After adoption certain technical/structural errors were discovered. These corrections were made at the December 1989 meeting. 1990 Proc. IB 872. A. A paper written to identify regulatory weaknesses reported that every state permits its domestic

insurers to take annual statement credit for reinsurance cessions made to admitted reinsurers. However, state laws appear to be quite diverse in defining the term. 1983 Proc. II 842. The model language originally adopted allowed credit where the assuming insurer was licensed to transact insurance in either the state adopting the law or one which employs standards “substantially similar” regarding credit for reinsurance. The section stated that “substantially similar” meant the insurer conformed to the same stand ards of solvency as required of an insurer licensed in the state. Just before the model was adopted, the task force voted to adopt a drafting note stating that the same standards of solvency meant, at a minimum, the capital and surplus required of a domes tic insurer. 1984 Proc. II 837- 838. The original model allowed credit for reinsurance if the assuming insurer was licensed in the state, or if the insurer was licensed in another state whose credit requirements were substantially equivalent to those in the state granting credit and where the assuming insurer meet the standards of solvency in the granting state. In most cases, satisfaction of the minimum capital and surplus levels sufficed. A number of insurers commented that

this requirement imposed an onerous regulatory burden and gave significant discretion to the commissioner, thus creating the potential for arbitrary decisions. 1984 Proc. II 843. When considering amendments to the model the drafters wanted to eliminate the vague “standards of solvency” but felt it was not feasible to enumerate all the standards for solvency that would be required if the assuming insurer were applying for a license in the enacting state. At the same time, they felt it would be a mistake to delete all references to s olvency. 1989 Proc. I 949. At one point in 1995 during discussion of model act revisions, a provision was inserted in Section 2A that would have prevented a company from taking credit for the reinsurance cession if the reinsuring company was not licensed to write a particular line of business in the state. That was changed to permit the credit if the reinsurer was authorized in its state of domicile to write or assume business of the type ceded. 1996 Proc. 1st Quarter 844. B. When originally adopted th e model provided that credit would be allowed if the assuming reinsurer was “accredited” without defining that term. 1984 Proc. II 838. In

the view of the advisory committee, this caused confusion. Credit could be allowed even though the reinsurer provi ded no information about its financial condition, did not submit to the jurisdiction, and provided no security in the form of letters of credit, funds withheld, or trusteed funds. The advisory group suggested a definition of accredited reinsurer which was similar to that adopted a year later. 1988 Proc. II 808, 810. NAIC Model Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Other Resources —Janu ary 2012 CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE MODEL LAW Proceeding Citations Cited to the Proceedings of the NAIC © 201 2 National Association of Insurance Commissioners PC-785-3 Section 2B (cont.) The purpose of the suggested definition of accredited reinsurer was to assure that the enacting state had current information about the reinsurer in annual statement format , that the enacting state had jurisdiction over the reinsurer, and that the enacting state could examine the reinsurer. An assuming reinsurer meeting all the criteria of the definition would be accredited and no affirmative action on the part of the commi ssioner of the enacting state would be required. 1988 Proc. II 808. One insurer responded to a draft which defined the accredited reinsurer as one

maintaining surplus as regards policyholders o f at least $20,000,000. The comments suggested that small li fe insurers would be seriously affected by the proposal. 1989 Proc. I 940. The drafters of amendments recommended deleting the vague “standards of solvency” of the earlier model and proposed substituting a minimum standard of $20,000,000. The figure was chosen to conform with the provision for trusteed surplus in Subsection D. 1989 Proc. I 949. At a working group meeting in the summer of 1989, the drafters decided to add the two alternative provisions under B(4). 1989 Proc. II 727. The amendment allo wed companies with less than $20,000,000 to apply for accreditation but did not allow these companies to use the deemer provision found in B(4)(a). 1989 Proc. II 728. The working group considered providing an exception for members of a pooling arrangement similar to that proposed for Subsection C. The group decided no change was required. 1989 Proc. II 727. An industry association presented a statement detailing the reasons they thought the action was appropriate. 1989 Proc. II 733- 734. C. The original act provided that credit should be allowed where the reinsurer was licensed in at least one state employing standards

substantially similar to those in the model. Model law amendments first suggested in 1988 provided credit where the assuming reinsurer was domiciled in a state employing substantially similar standards. 1988 Proc. II 808. Concerns were expressed about the interpretation of the words “substantially similar.” The advisory committee suggested this could best be handled through the additi on of a drafting note. 1989 Proc. I 948. The model is a minimum standards bill. It is contemplated that a number of states will have standards which exceed those of the state enacting the model. The drafters expected that the NAIC would maintain a list or digest of states which have enacted the model. The drafting note permits the commissioner to rely on such a digest or to make an independent determination. 1989 Proc. I 948. When considering possible model amendments in 1994, the chair of the workin g group asked for regulators’ opinions regarding a modification to Subsection C to include a requirement that the reinsurer be domiciled in a state accredited by th e NAIC. An interested party said such a provision could be readily incorporated into that s ubsection by replacing the words “…which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance

substantially similar to those applicable under this statute…” with the words “…which has been accredited by the NAIC…”. 1994 Proc. 1st Quarter 637. Recommendatio ns from technical resource advisors spoke against adding a tie to the accreditation standards. A voluntary program on the part of the NAIC (a voluntary association of insurance regulators), the program could be substantially revised or canceled. In addi tion, they argued, tying the standard to the NAIC accredited status of the reinsurer’s state of domicile could result in denial of credit even where the lack of NAIC accredited status was unrelated to that state’s credit for reinsurance standards. The “su bstantially similar” standard rests on an objective determination of the law of the reinsurer’s state of domicile. 1995 Proc. 1st Quarter 752. NAIC Model Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Other Resources —January 2012 CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE MODEL LAW Proceeding Citations Cited to the Proceedings of the NAIC PC-785-4 © 2012 National Association of Insurance Commissioners Section 2 (cont.) D. The model law adopted granted credit where the assuming insurer maintained a trusteed account in the United States which included the insurer’s liabilities and a trusteed surplus. The committee considered capital and surplus requirements a s a

threshold for the trusteed surplus but concluded that, in view of current industry practices and con ditions, higher standards were mandated. Some insurers commented that the amounts were so high that many alien reinsurers could not compete in the U.S. market. The drafters concluded that the $20,000,000 amount was necessary to maintain the level of secu rity provided by the other provisions of the law. 1984 Proc. II 844. Originally the model required the trust fund be maintained in a U.S. bank or trust company. This was changed to “qualified financial institution” in 1987. 1987 Proc. II 444. The draf ters considered changes to this section to deal with “joint and several” characteristics of the trust, but decided to do additional research before making any changes to the model. 1989 Proc. II 727- 728. Just before adoption of the amended model in Septe mber 1989, the working group and then the task force considered adding a second paragraph under Subsection D to include incorporated underwriters. Considerable discussion on this proposal included the opinion that the language was unclear, and that additi on of this paragraph would give special advantage to alien insurers. Some felt the proposal should be voted down

because it was a last minute proposal. The proposal was narrowly approved. 1990 Proc. IB 891, 895. The parent committee again considered th e appropriateness of the addition of Subsection D(2). The advisory committee objected to giving alien insurers a right that United States companies did not enjoy abroad, and opined that the internationa l aspects of this decision had not been considered. The committee chair replied that, in fact, the international aspects had been considered and noted that an open market was, in the long term, in the best interest of the United States market. 1990 Proc. IB 851. Before adoption the committee struck a phrase in Subsection D(2), “or some other national regulation” and replaced it with a phrase requiring the incorporated insurers to submit to the state’s authority to examine its books and records. 1990 Proc. IB 851. The NAIC president clarified before adopt ion at the special plenary session that the incorporated insurers would submit to the authority of the states and bear the cost of any examination. 1990 Proc. IA 12. Some of the commissioners were concerned about the authority granted in Subsection D(2). They clarified that this applies only to reinsurance transactions, not to

surplus lines. 1990 Proc. IA 13. In June of 1990 the working group was again asked to reconsider Section 2D(2) dealing with a group of incorporated insurers. It was the opinion of the working group that the provision in question would allow more security for the reinsurance recoverable than the alternatives. The group voted to retain the provision as adopted. 1990 Proc. II 776. The working group did adopt clarifying language t o Subsection D(2) specifying the trust should be in an amount equal to the liabilities attributable to United States business. The language of the earlier model also did not make clear that credit is to be accorded only to reinsurance contracts issued in the group name. 1990 Proc. II 776- 777. Another amendment removed language specifically referencing companies under the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry of the United Kingdom. The working group considered this language too restrictive . It was replaced with language from a New York regulation. 1990 Proc. II 776.

PC-785-5 Section 2D (cont.) In September 1993 a working group agreed upon language to amend Section 2D(1) of the model law to permit companies to continue to take statutory credit fo r reinsurance ceded to Lloyd’s after the introduction of corporate capital. The chair acknowledged that there were other areas of the model law that would have to be reexamined to determine whether revisions might be necessary, but priority was given to the language on corporate Lloyd’s. 1993 Proc. 4th Quarter 881. One meeting attendee said it was important to be certain that language drafted was not worded so broadly as to permit any group which included individuals and had established a trust fund in the amount of $100 million to qualify as an accredited reinsurer and thereby circumvent other applicable requirements, such as those for risk -based capital. 1993 Proc. 4th Quarter 881-882. One of the drafting suggestions narrowed the scope by specificall y referring to Lloyd’s. A comment was made that explicit reference to “underwriters at Lloyd’s” could present a problem for states that had statutory prohibitions against special purpose legislation. 1993 Proc. 4th Quarter 881 -882. The working group mem bers agreed that the suggested amendatory language

would satisfactorily address the concerns expressed. The chair noted several unresolved questions remained and that further revisions to the model law would be considered. 1993 Proc. 4th Quarter 883. The language of Subsection D(2) was extensively revised in 1996 and some replaced with new language found in Paragraphs (2) and (3). 1996 Proc. 2nd Quarter 13 -14. A group considering amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law received a letter outl ining reasons why granting credit for reinsurance is sound financial regulation, pro -competitive and proper. The letter also addressed the scope of the trust fund to assist the regulators as they considered amending the trust requirements. 1994 Proc. 2nd Quarter 871 -872. Technical resource advisors urged the working group to consider adding provisions that would apply to a single alien reinsurer seeking to qualify under Section 2D(1) of the model law. An extended discussion followed, during which the chair observed that under the arrangement proposed, the credit risk of reinsurance recoverables would effectively be borne by the trust. An interested party responded with the viewpoint that the proposal would enhance the overall quality of security, whilew orking to the advantage of U.S. reinsurers, since it could be expected

that a substantial volume of retrocessional business would flow into the U.S. marketplace as a result of the incentives for trusteed alien reinsurers to buy retro protec tions from licen sed reinsurers. He suggested it would be good regulatory policy to encourage any arrangement that provided such advantages. The chair countered that good regulatory policy should require that the obligations of alien reinsurers be collateralized on a gro ss basis, noting that it was not realistic to expect regulators to evaluate every alien reinsurer’s retrocessional arrangements. Another regulator observed it would be difficult to make such evaluations because of the potential depletion of recoverable balances as a result of allowable offsets. The interested party acknowledged this was a legitimate concern, but said it could be possible to devise a way to address that problem. 1994 Proc. 2nd Quarter 868- 869. An interested party commented that her association’s members thought reinsurance capacity might be restricted if alien reinsurers were subjected to unduly burdensome collateralization requirements. The member companies were less concerned over recoverability than they were over the potential for capacity restriction and increases in the cost of reinsurance and said that they apparently believed that they were capable of determining,

either on their own or with the advice of their reinsurance intermediaries, the creditworthiness of alien insurers. 1 994 Proc. 4th Quarter 959. NAIC Model Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Other Resources —January 2012 CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE MODEL LAW Proceeding Citations Cited to the Proceedings of the NAIC PC-785-6 © 2012 National Association of Insurance Commissioners Section 2D (cont.) The chair asked if eliminating offset provision from retrocessional covers was a viable method of alleviating the concerns of regulators regarding the potentially negative impact of offset provisions on their ability to recover amounts for which alien reinsurers had taken credit in their U.S. trust funds. One company representative said in his opinion very few reinsurers co uld be expected to willingly forego the protection afforded by offset provisions, and that the elimination of offset clauses would inevitably lead to a general increase in the cost of reinsurance to reflect the attendant increase in the claims burden that reinsurers would have to bear in the absence of traditional offset provisions. He obs erved that the ultimate effect of any loss of offset rights would be to weaken reinsurers’ financial conditions generally, and said that to do so would be in the intere

st of neither the buyers of reinsurance protection nor of the regulator. 1994 Proc. 4th Quarter 959. An interested party opined that the current model law requirement that alien reinsurers fund an amount equal to U.S. liabilities plus $20 million did not leave a very substantial margin for unrecoverability of obligations of the alien reinsu rer’s retrocessionaires. He observed that the risk -based capital requirements made it impossible for any state to approve a new reinsurer having only $20 million in policyholder surplus. 1994 Proc. 4th Quarter 959. An early 1995 draft of the model act c ontained a new Subsection E to address reinsurance ceded to an unauthorized alien assuming insurer. A technical resource advisor reported that there was not agreement among the advisors regarding the subsection. The majority of advisors recommended that, if the working group wanted to include a provision of this kind, it would best be done via a drafting note to the model regulation. 1995 Proc. 1st Quarter 731. An extensive discussion followed among the working group members regarding the question of whether the language of the state regulation on which Subsection E was based was more or less conservative as respects security required of

alien reinsurers than the provisions currently contained in Section 2 and 3 of the model law. There were divergent op inions among regulators as to whether this provision had the effect of strengthening or weakening the alien reinsurer security provisions currently incorporated in the model law. One interested party suggested the availability of the proposed Subsection E would effectively reduce the overall level of security for unauthorized reinsurance recoverables. 1995 Proc. 1st Quarter 732. A regulator said in his opinion the proposed Subsection E represented a clear weakening of the traditional requirements regardi ng collateralization of unauthorized reinsurance recoverables, since the effect of the provision would be to substitute collateral equal to only 15% of the largest segment of recoverable balances, the resources for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) losses, for the 100% requirement contained in the present model. He said he would be opposed to inclusion of such a provision in any form. 1995 Proc. 1st Quarter 732. The working group agreed not to make substantive changes to Subsection D, but the subsection w as rearranged for clarity. 1995 Proc. 1st Quarter 733- 734. One regulator suggested a change to the second sentence in Paragraph (1) to add at

the beginning of the phrase “To enable the commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund…” and the working group agreed to the change. 1996 Proc. 1st Quarter 844. It was suggested that the language of Paragraph (3)(i) would effectively permit adequacy of the trust fund established by a “group including incorporated and individual unincorporated under writers” to be determined on a collective basis, which meant that one or more individual underwriters or syndicates could have a deficiency in their subaccount balances. If the overall fund balance was deemed to be adequate, credit for cessions to the gro up would be allowed despite the individual deficiency. One state had taken the position that each syndicate would have to demonstrate compliance with trust fund requirements. The technical resource group believed that the language in its current form wou ld permit any regulator to exercise sufficient oversight and control, and cautioned against efforts to introduce expanded requirements that would increase the administrative burden on regulators without providing a commensurate increase in the ability to m aintain oversight and control. 1996 Proc. 1st Quarter 844- 845.

Proceeding Citations Cited to the Proceedings of the NAIC © 201 2 National Association of Insurance Commissioners PC-785-7 Section 2D (cont.) E. Subsection E remains substantially unchanged since it was first adopted, except for the references to other subsections. 1984 Proc. II 838. The drafters recognized a special problem for reinsurers in many non -U.S. jurisdictions and carved out a limited exception to the credit requirements. A ceding insurer may take credit where the assuming insurer does not meet the standards of the prio r subsections with regard to risks located in jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by that jurisdiction. 1984 Proc. II 844. F. The assuming insurer qualifying for credit must also agree to submit to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts in the event of its failure to pay amounts due under contracts, and to designate the commissioner as its attorney for the purpose of serving process. A few insurers were concerned that this subsection might alter the terms of an arbitration clause in the reinsurance agreement. The drafters added the final sentence to remove the potential for any unintended conflict with arbitration clauses. 1984 Proc. II 844. A correction made in 1985 clarified that the last sentence

of the subsection applied both to Paragraphs (1) and (2). 1986 Proc. I 812. The working group considered a proposal that the model bill specify certain provisions which must be included in a reinsurance contract. The advisory committee felt it was not feasible to set out all of the minimum standards but the model does include cert ain standards in Section 2F. 1989 Proc. I 949. Section 3. Asset or Reduction From Liability for Reinsurance Ceded by a Domestic Insurer to an Assuming Insurer Not Meeting the Requirement of Section 2 The model adopted allowed a reduction from liability for cessions to assuming insurers not satisfying the requirements of Section 2, but only to the extent of security provided by, or on behalf of, the insurer taking credit. The model identified the forms of security accepted in most states. The model as o riginally adopted only accepted letters of credit issued or confirmed by a bank that is a member of the federal reserve system. 1984 Proc. II 844. An amendment adopted in September 1989 added the words “by a domestic insurer” to the title and first sente nce. 1990 Proc. IB 859. C. A representative of a British banking

firm appeared before the task force to protest the use of the standards for letters of credit which excluded U.S. branches and agencies of all foreign banks from eligibility as issuers of l etters of credit. 1985 Proc. II 719- 720. In 1987 this section was changed to allow letters of credit issued by a “qualified U.S. financial institution” as that term w as defined in a new Section 4. 1987 Proc. II 446. The United States Treasury Departmen t wrote a letter expressing support for the draft. It moves in the direction of applying equality of competitive opportunity with U.S. banks, to U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banking institutions. The Treasury Department heard complaints from ind ividual foreign banks concerning their inability to participate in the market in the United States. Under the International Banking Act, foreign banks are accorded equality of competitive opportunity with domestic institutions in similar circumstances, ev en if some specific regulations or requirements applied to foreign banks differ from those affecting domestic banks. The measures contemplated by the NAIC were in keeping with federal policy. 1987 Proc. II 449- 450. NAIC Model Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Other Resources —January 2012 CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE

Section 3C contai ned a reference to the definition for letters of credit; however, the version adopted in 1990 contained a reference to the definition in Section 4 which was misplaced. A correction was made in June 1990. 1990 Proc. II 776. Section [ ] Credit Allowed a F oreign Ceding Insurer [Optional] As early as August 1993, the chair of the working group considering credit for reinsurance issues received a suggestion to ad d a new section to the model act that would allow credit to a foreign ceding insurer to the exten t credit had been allowed by the ceding insurer’s state of domicile. 1994 Proc. 1st Quarter 639. In early 1994, the Credit for Reinsurance Working Group began discussing further amendments to the model act. A group of technical advisors wrote a letter u rging the viewpoint that credit for reinsurance should be determined by the state of domicile of the ceding insurer and that, if that state is accredited by the NAIC, other states should recognize the credit allowed by the state of

domicile. The group viewed this as a very important principle. The writers said it seemed to them unnecessary and undesirable to have a separate and inconsistent determination of statutory surplus made by each state in which the ceding insurer is licensed. 1994 Proc. 1st Quar ter 640. One regulator restated the position taken by his state on the question of application of its law to licensed foreign ceding companies as well as domestic companies. He said his state supported the idea of uniformity of regulation from one state to another insofar as possible, but did not want to relinquish the right to take regulatory action against a foreign company who se reinsurance arrangements were deemed to be unsatisfactory. Another regulator pointed out that the commissioner was permitted the discretion to waive the $20 million surplus stipulated in the model. 1994 Proc. 1st Quarter 637. A regulator suggested that language be added to the proposed section setting forth criteria by which a state might decline to allow credit. 1994 Proc. 1st Quarter 637. A later meeting was held to consider further the concept of extraterritorial application of the credit for reinsurance law. Language was drafted that would provide a procedure to

be followed by those states that chose to apply their cred it for reinsurance law to licensed foreign companies as well as domestic companies. Technical resource advisors expressed concern with the basic premise. They expressed the strong belief that credit for reinsurance is a fundamental element in the determi nation of the financial condition of the ceding insurer, and should be determined by the insurer’s state of domicile. They urged regulators not to change the feature of the current model that addresses credits allowed domestic insurers and does not addres s foreign insurers. 1994 Proc. 2nd Quarter 877- 879. A draft of the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law was considered at a September 1994 meeting of regulators. A drafting note was suggested for the new section on regulation of reinsurance of foreign carri ers by non -domiciliary jurisdictions, and one regulator wrote a letter of objection to the drafting note. The regulator stated that the drafting note contained language that implied a consensus of opinion which, in his view, did not exist among regulators as respects extraterritorial application of the act. At his suggestion these words were deleted at the end of the first sentence: “…on the premise that regulation

of the financial condition of foreign insurers, including credit for reinsurance, is best left to their states of domicile.” The letter writer said the premise was presumptuous in its far -reaching implications, i.e., that it is “best” for the individual states to relinquish, or to abdicate, their regulatory responsibilities regarding the finan cial condition of foreign insurers doing business within their borders. 1994 Proc. 3rd Quarter 783- 784. NAIC Model Laws, Regulations, Guidelines and Other Resources —Janu ary 2012 CREDIT FOR REINSURANCE MODEL LAW Proceeding Citations Cited to the Proceedings of the NAIC © 201 2 National Association of Insurance Commissioners PC-785-9 Section 4. Qualified U.S. Financial Institutions This section was added to the model in 1987. Changes to the types of financial institutions that could maintain trust funds or issue letters of credit resulted in the need for this definition. 1987 Proc. II 447. A. The Reinsurance and Anti -Fraud Task Force created new language defining credit standards for domestic and foreign banks which issue let ters of credit supporting reinsurance transactions. The language also became part of the procedures of the NAIC Securities Valuation Office. The “member of the federal reserve” requirement embodied in the original model was

eliminated to allow foreign ba nks which cannot be members of the federal reserve to write letters of credit. The new SVO facility will provide a list of qualified banks for use by regulators in approving letters of credit transactions involving reinsurance credit. 1987 Proc. II 855- 856. Section 5. Rules and Regulations The authority to adopt regulations was part of the original model, although the NAIC did not develop a regulation for some time. 1984 Proc. II 839. When drafting amendments in 1989, the working group considered a pr oposal to require a state to adopt rules and regulations versus the optional authority in the model. The group agreed no change was required. 1989 Proc. II 727. Section 6. Reinsurance Agreements Affected This section was added to the draft of amendment s being considered at the December 1988 meeting. It was suggested by the advisory committee that the model should identify those reinsurance contracts to which the statutory credit provisions would be applicable. 1989 Proc. I 949. At the working group m eeting the following summer, it was decided to add a drafting note to the working draft. 1989 Proc. II 727. ________________________________ Chronological Summary of Actions June 1984:
